## Run it locally

## History of the project

I started this project as a learning project, in order to improve my TypeScript knowledge.

I got inspired by many projects which are rendering ASCII diagrams, like
[Markdeep](https://github.com/morgan3d/markdeep), or [ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/).

On top of what Markdeep is doing I wanted to create an editor as well. And
as opposed to ditaa which is a server side solution, I wanted a solution which works in the browser.
